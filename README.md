## Dataset

We use publicly available benchmark datasets in this project.  
All datasets are placed in the `data/` folder.

Please note:  
You will need to **generate erroneous data yourself** based on the dataset you choose to use with our method.  
Our code does not include automatic error generation, as this process may vary depending on the dataset and task.
